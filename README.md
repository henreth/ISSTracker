# ISSTracker
Simple Real Time International Space Station (ISS) Tracker made using Javascript. For tutorial, visit my blog --> https://thecodingpie.com

## Hey there!
If you try to simply download this project and try to run it, the Map won't be visible or you can't see the Map Tiles. \nBecause you need an API "accessToken" from Mapbox.\nTo get your Mapbox API "accessToken":\n
1). visit here--> https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/ (do Signup or SignIn)
2). After doing Signup or SignIn, you will be able to see your API accessToken under "Default public token" in the main page.
3). Now pick your "accessToken" and replace this line 'your.mapbox.access.token' inside script.js file with your accessToken.
4). Now the ISS Tracker will work fine :)
